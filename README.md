# Autonomous_Car
## Overview

This project implements a simple autonomous car capable of lane detection and following in a simulated environment. The system uses computer vision techniques to detect lane lines (yellow and white) and controls the car's steering and speed accordingly.
The project is designed to work with the AVIS Engine simulator and uses Python with OpenCV for image processing.
